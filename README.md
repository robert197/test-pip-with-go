# Test Pip Install with Go

This is a simple project demonstrating how to package a Go binary along with a Python wrapper and make it installable using pip.

## Getting Started

1. **Go Binary**

   The Go binary in this project prints "Hello from Go!".

2. **Python Wrapper**

   The Python wrapper script (`wrapper.py`) executes the Go binary and prints its output.

3. **Tests**

   The python file (`wrapper_test.py`) executes one tests to test the output of the golang binary.

## Installation

You can install this package using pip:

```bash
pip install go-pkg
```
